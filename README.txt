Problems encountered: Alumni society says that students can not access their database. (That’s fine! We’ll create our own data — there’s a section on the site to submit data into the database). They said we may be able to meet and “figure something out”. Per Dr. Stout: this only really affects undergraduates, as graduate cohorts are part of a smaller group and therefore easier to contact. And the MVP covers graduate alumni; undergraduates are a bonus.
